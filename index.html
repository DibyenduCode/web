Started in 1911, the library was one of the earliest central facilities to have been started by the Institute for teaching and research. Initially, the library was housed in the majestic main building. The library moved into the present premises in January 1965, built out of grants provided by University Grants Commission (UGC) in commemoration of the golden jubilee celebrations of the Institute in 1959. In 1995, the library was renamed as "J.R.D. Tata Memorial Library". The library is centrally located and its total area measures more than 5,000 sq. mts. </p></font>
